# Sleep Chronotype Quiz — GitHub Pages Ready

This is a static website that runs entirely in the browser. It includes:
- Multi-step quiz
- Category-based scoring (Daily, Lifestyle, Mental, Goals)
- Circadian rhythm detection and sleep persona
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Local saving of progress and last result
- Share/copy result with fallbacks

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (Quick)
1. Create a public repository on GitHub (or use `yourname.github.io`).
2. Upload all files from this project root (index.html, style.css, script.js, assets/).
3. In your repository Settings → Pages, set Source to `main` branch (root).
4. After a minute your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## Notes
- Images are inside `assets/` folder; filenames are case-sensitive.
- No server required — everything is client-side.
